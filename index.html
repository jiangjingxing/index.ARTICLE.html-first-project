        <p style="color:blue">That was not a pet that was a weird lookingv watermelon guy with goggles. I always wanted a ragdoll cat.
            see in the image bellow it is a cat with whiite fur,blue eyes and is very big. Not to be confused with the mainecoon which comes in diffrent colors, has a pointy face,and triangular ears.<br> As opposed to a ragdoll's round face with rounder ears if you confuse those two I dont know what is wrong with you. <a href="https://www.google.com">here</a>
