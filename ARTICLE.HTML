<p>As mentioned in the previous website. The infamous hippo,aka "THE FAT MAN"strikes a supermarket with suprising speed.
    citizens rush out of the supermarket holding their dumb phones and taking pictures like real idiots only to be sat on by that infamous hippo. THE FAT MAN continues to eat potatos and sit on unlucky civilians, "that is a WEIRD! looking dog!" a hobo down the street yells. a bystander was so amazed that he created a television show called,Fat Hippo. All episodes streaming on disney plus. We will see you next time, on CBA news. Follow up <a href="file:///C:/Users/welle/Documents/Ethan/index.html">here</a>

Jake, the guy who created the television series (named,What Do I do now,) decided to have a heart attack and signed up for a hashbrown eating contest. his last words being, <span style="font-size:35px">WHAT DID I DO TO MYSELF</span></p>

<p> THE FAT MAN will attack on <time datetime="2022-07-07">July 7</time> in London's Hyde Park.
    <span style="font-size:32px">Markus</span> and <span style="font-size:32px">Samuel</span>. Jake's sister named Gerald filmed the three animals atching a stupid plan that probably had to do something withe THE FAT MAN eating 10000000000000 tons of canned beans. local officials still have not found out the full flan, but at least we have a start.
